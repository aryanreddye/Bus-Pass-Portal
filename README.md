---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

At this stage, the website is a **frontend-only prototype**. Here's what to keep in mind:

- ❌ **No database integration**  
  Data is not stored or retrieved from a database.

- ❌ **Register page does not persist data**  
  Although it looks functional, it doesn't actually store user information yet.

- ❌ **Bus Pass details are pre-defined**  
  Currently, the bus pass info shown is static and not dynamically generated based on user input.

## 📈 What's Next?

- Adding MongoDB backend integration for storing user data  
- Displaying personalized information after login  
- Admin approval system for route changes or renewals
